# This is a project from The Open University of Israel
# C-Assembler
We were given a new programing language.
The program reads a file written with the new programing language.
The program will read the file twice:

1. Search for errors in the language (wrong formatting or incorrect calls).
2. Translate each line of code into binary code (Also introduced in the assignment) and then output the code into a file in quaternary code.
